    "# <span style=\"color:red\">Predicting US Presidential Election Result Using Twitter Sentiment Analysis</span> \n",
    "\n",
    "According to [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sentiment_analysis), sentiment analysis refers to the use of natural language processing, text analysis, computational linguistics, and biometrics to systematically identify, extract, quantify, and study affective states and subjective information. Is the process of ‘computationally’ determining whether a piece of writing is positive, negative or neutral. It’s also known as opinion mining, deriving the opinion or attitude of a speaker.\n",
    "\n",
    "Sentiment analysis is used by a number of data analytics companies on a variety of subjects. Some of the popular markets where it is used are:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Business: Sentiment analysis in business can prove a major breakthrough for the complete brand revitalization. The key to running a successful business with the sentiments data is the ability to exploit the unstructured data for actionable insights. The marketing team of many companies use it to create business strategies, to understand how customers perceive their product and to understand customer behavior in order to improve sales.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Politics: In the political field, it is used to keep track of regions where the candidate is favourable and work towards regions where the candidate is not favourable in order to improve their chances in an election.\n",
    "\n",
    "The US presidential election was on November 3 and it seems like a good idea to understand the mood and public opinion in different US states towards the candidates: current Republican President Donald Trump and the Democratic challenger Joe Biden.\n",
    "\n",
    "When you think of politicians and Twitter, chances are President Donald J. Trump comes to mind. Ever since he launched his run for office in 2015, Trump has become infamous for what many have described as derogatory, negative, and somewhat inflammatory tweets. Turns out that with even as little as 280 characters, he can communicate a whole spectrum of emotions, facts, and opinions. This [article](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2019/11/02/us/politics/trump-twitter-presidency.html) published by NYT in 2019 ilustrates this.\n",
    "\n",
    "The dramatic increase in the number of users on social media platform leads to the generation of huge amount of unstructured text in the form of messages, chats, posts and blogs. Besides the exchange of information, social media is a remarkably convenient medium to express the ideas and opinions which gain popularity when liked by a large set of users. This popularity may reflect the sentiment of people towards that person, organization or a place.\n",
    "\n",
    "The social media platform, such as Twitter, generates huge amounts of the text containing political insights, which can be mined to analyze the people’s opinion and predict the future trends in the elections.\n",
    "\n",
    "For this analysis, I collected tweets a week before the election day (since October 26th) using the publicly available Twitter API and performed a sentiment analysis of those tweets using VADER Sentiment Analysis."
